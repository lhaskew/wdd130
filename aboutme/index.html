    <h2>Lucy Haskew</h2>
    <p>Hi everyone! My name is Lucy Haskew, soon to be Lucy Bryant. I will be getting married to my sweetheart fiance in July. I am from Nampa, Idaho. 
    I work full-time as a software developer for an off-road company, and I am loving it so far! I am a computer science major.</p>
    <p>Something interesting about me is that I love backpacking and hiking. I went over 500 miles in just 2023. I don't have as much time on my hands 
    now that I did then, but my passion for seeing this beautiful world still remains. I also love playing instruments and singing. I am learning a song
    on the guitar right now. </p>
