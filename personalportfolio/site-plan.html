      <p>
        Hello there! My name is Lucy Haskew, a passionate Computer Science student at Brigham Young University – Idaho. With my background in software development, I seek to gain more experience within the realms of the software industry.  Since 2022, I have been degree-seeking, but my love for programming didn’t start there. In the summer of 2018, I started learning basic JavaScript and wrote my own video game. Over the years, I’ve had the privilege of working on diverse projects that range from developing interactive user interfaces to automating data systems within my current place of employment. 
      </p>
      <p>
        My estimated graduation date is Spring 2025. I will then be attaining a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I yearn to continue on this progressive path of learning and professional growth. Following my graduation, I hope to further my career in workplaces that provide me opportunities to learn and grow in my personal and professional development. My career path is focused on drive, intuition, progression, and success. I understand that success does not come easily, and as such, I promote a positive attitude towards individual growth.

      <h3>Page 2: Subpage/Resume and Experience Showcase</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome to my portfolio! I am Lucy Haskew, an eager software developer currently finishing up my final year as a Computer Science major at Brigham Young University – Idaho. This career path first piqued my interest back in middle school, and it has since come a long way. I have learned to cultivate a strong foundation in data management through project management, problem-solving, strategic planning, and advanced software development. This has enabled me to deliver a variety of successful results across a variety of projects in personal, educational, and professional standpoints.
      </p>
      <p> 
        My professional journey is defined through my pursuit of accomplishment, innovation, and articulation. I excel in the workplace when I am given the opportunity to express my creativity and approach projects with innovative initiatives to create impactful solutions.
      </p>
      <p> 
        Thank you for taking the time to explore my portfolio. If you have any questions or are interested in hearing more about potential collaborations, I would be grateful to hear from you. I am eager to explore new opportunities!

      <h3>Page 3: Subpage/Hobbies, Goals, and Personal Projects</h3>
      <p>
        Outside of my professional life, I have a wide variety of hobbies that shape who I am! I love to enjoy beauty, and I feel that I can find that the most through music, enjoying the outdoors, and sharing memories with my family. I am an avid outdoorswoman. I love everything that involves being in nature. I absolutely love backpacking, rock climbing, off-roading, rafting, snowboarding, running… you name it, I probably do it or would like to someday. Fun fact about me, in 2023 I hiked just barely over 500 miles over the span of 5 months in the states of Idaho, Montana, Utah, and Wyoming! I also play 5 different instruments: piano, organ, clarinet, ukulele, and guitar. I am very family oriented and love spending as much time as I can with those who are close to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have always been widely known throughout my educational years as a woman with drive. I believe that having a drive to accomplish goals is what really defines a person’s success and overall life satisfaction. I know that there is power in continuing through failure to reach your goals. Life is not always fair in what it throws at you, but even when I face this seemingly unfair circumstances, I always get back up on my feet.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to my academic work, I have a broad spectrum of personal projects that allow me to diversify my portfolio with passion and creativity. These projects range through many different software languages, each with unique structures, designs, and user interfaces.
