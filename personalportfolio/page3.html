            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>Outside of my professional life, I have a wide variety of hobbies that shape who I am! I love to enjoy beauty, and I feel that I can find that the most through music, enjoying the outdoors, and sharing memories with my family. I am an avid outdoorswoman. I love everything that involves being in nature. I absolutely love backpacking, rock climbing, off-roading, rafting, snowboarding, running… you name it, I probably do it or would like to someday. Fun fact about me, in 2023 I hiked just barely over 500 miles over the span of 5 months in the states of Idaho, Montana, Utah, and Wyoming! I also play 5 different instruments: piano, organ, clarinet, ukulele, and guitar. I am very family oriented and love spending as much time as I can with those who are close to me.</p>

            <h2>Goals and Personal Projects</h2>
            <p>I have always been widely known throughout my educational years as a woman with drive. I believe that having a drive to accomplish goals is what really defines a person’s success and overall life satisfaction. I know that there is power in continuing through failure to reach your goals. Life is not always fair in what it throws at you, but even when I face this seemingly unfair circumstances, I always get back up on my feet.</p>
            <p>In addition to my academic work, I have a broad spectrum of personal projects that allow me to diversify my portfolio with passion and creativity. These projects range through many different software languages, each with unique structures, designs, and user interfaces.</p>
